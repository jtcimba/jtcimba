## Hi I'm Jake

I’m a full stack engineer who loves to make things. Whether it’s creating designs in Figma, developing new web and mobile apps using React and AWS, or iterating on enterprise software within larger teams, my goal is to add value at each phase of the product life cycle and build great software.

Some industries of interest include climate tech, healthcare, and small business.

Outside of work you can find me jamming on electric guitar, cooking Italian food, and exploring national parks.
